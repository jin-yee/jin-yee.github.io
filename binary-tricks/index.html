                <h2 class="general-title">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Here I share a list of binary operations I have found/seen from books and codes
                    from other programmers, that
                    I find them intrigued and useful (at least for me).</p>

                <h2 class="general-title">Testing if a Number is even</h2>
                <p>
                    While many would use modulus 2, to test a number is even or not, you simply check the least
                    significant bit (lsb) of the number is 1
                    (odd) or 0 (even). For example,
                    \[19283_{10} \land 1 = 1 (odd)\]
                    \[284_{10} \land 1 = 0 (even)\]
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="general-title">"Fast" Modulus</h2>
                <p>
                    This is actually an extension of the knowledge from the last part. In the last section,
                    <code>AND</code> 1 is used to replaced the modulus of 2, to test if number is even (divisible by 2).
                </p>
                <p>But I would like to take this furthur a bit, by understanding that if a number
                    \(x\) is not divisible by \(y\), the remainder \(r\) of the division will consists of integer in the
                    range of \(r \in [0,y-1] \). For example, 13 is not divisible by 5, and the remainder is 3, 14 is
                    not too and remainder yields 4.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here we observe one pattern, for number that's \(2^n\) where \(n\) is positive integer, if you take
                    any numbers divided by it, the remainder will be in range of \([0, 2^n - 1]\). For example, is the
                    divisor is 8, the remainder will be one of \(0, 1, 2, ... 7\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can observe, that when getting remainder of a number divided by divisor that's \(2^n\), or
                    going back to our topic,
                    <b>to
                        perform the modulus operation of a number against \(2^n\)</b>, the remainder is actually falls
                    at those bits that's at position less than \(2^n\). To extract those bits out, simply we can use a
                    <code>AND</code> operator, or namely
                    \[x \mod 2^n \equiv x \land 2^n - 1\]
                </p>
                <p>The <code>AND</code> \(2^n - 1\) will mask out every bit that's before \(2^n\).
                    Let's consider the following examples:
                    $$ 156 \mod 16 = 12 \equiv 156 \land (16 - 1) = 12$$
                    $$ \begin{array} {|r|r|}\hline & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline \land & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 &
                    1
                    & 1 & 1 \\ \hline & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline \end{array}$$
                </p>
                <p>So you just turn a long division problem to a bitwise operation. That's the power
                    of 2!</p>

            <div>
                <h2 class="general-title">Taking out the least significant 1</h2>
                <p>
                    We all know 2's complement, just a reminder, it's used to represent negative number in computers.
                    Here is the procedure of getting a 2's complement of a number
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Inverting all bits, e.g. 5 in binary \(0101\), inverting all bits \(1010\)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add 1 to the inverted number, e.g. \(0101 + 1 = 1011\)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                If we take a number and <code>AND</code> with its 2's complement, surprisingly (for me) it will yield
                the value of the least significant 1 in the number. Let's take 6 for example, its binary is \(0110\) and
                its 2's complement is \(1010\), performing <code>AND</code> operation as described,

                \begin{array} {|r|r|}\hline & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline \land & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
                \hline \end{array}

                The result is \(2_{10}\) or \(0010_{2}\), if not surprised, the least significant 1 of 6 is actually at
                the
                position where \(2^1\)
                </p>

            <div>
                <h2 class="general-title">Padding</h2>
                <p>
                    In programming quite often you will see problem such as finding the required number of character(s)
                    ,\(n\), to pad in front of a string of length \(s\) such that \(n + s\) is a multiple of some
                    integer \(i\).
                    For example, in AES-128 encryption, which requires one to provide a plain text of multiple of 16
                    bytes, and if not you have to pad it until its length is multiple of 16 bytes.
                <p>
                    Provided such problem statement, one would naturally comes out with the following simple solution:
                <ol>
                    <li>Starting from its current length \(s\), check if it's multiple of the integer \(i\) by using the
                        modulus (checking if \(s \mod i\) is zero)</li>
                    <li>If it's not, increment the number by 1, repeat step 1, until its final length is multiple of
                        \(i\)</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach is not that bad, after all, the worst we could go for the 16 bytes case is to iterate
                    15 times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if the <b>final length of the padded array/text/string is a multiple of power of 2</b>, the
                    following bitwise
                    operation can gives you the required pad length in a one line
                    $$ pad \ length = (\neg s + 1) \land (i - 1) $$
                    The left operand of <code>AND</code> is the 2's complement of the original string length \(s\);
                    \(i\) is the "block size" that will wholly divide the final length of the string
                </p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                    One thing to note that this only works, if the final length of entity has to be multiple of \(2^n\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, an string of length 13, has to be padded with '0' until its length is of multiple of 16
                    (\(2^4\)), find the number of '0' required to pad.
                    \[\begin{align}
                    pad \ length &= (\neg 1101_2 + 1_2) \land (00010000_2 - 1_2) \\
                    &= 0011_2 \land 1111_2 \\
                    &= 0011_2 \\
                    &= 3_{10}
                    \end{align}\]
                </p>
                <p>So we need to pad another 3 character to make 13 becomes 16, which makes sense.
                    Reader can try for other length and see the result.</p>
